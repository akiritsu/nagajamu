[**Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Declarative Problem Solving**](https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Representation-Reasoning-Declarative-Problem/dp/0521818028/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Knowledge+representation%2C+reasoning+and+declarative+problem+solving&qid=1555168380&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull), 1st Edition, 2003, Chitta Baral

- **Readership:** _graduates, researchers, software pactitioners, knowledge engineers_
- Chitta Baral demonstrates how to write programs that behave intelligently by giving them the ability to **express knowledge and reason about it**. He presents a language, AnsProlog, for both knowledge representation and reasoning, and declarative problem solving.

[**Handbook of Knowledge Representation**](https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Representation-Foundations-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0444522115/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=handbook+of+knowledge+representation&qid=1556087224&s=gateway&sr=8-1), 1st Edition, 2008, Frank van Harmelen, Vladimir Lifschitz, Bruce Porter

- **Readership:** _graduates, researchers, software pactitioners, knowledge engineers_
- Handbook of Knowledge Representation describes the essential foundations of Knowledge Representation, which lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The book provides an **up-to-date review of twenty-five key topics in knowledge representation**, written by the leaders of each field. It includes a tutorial background and cutting-edge developments, as well as applications of Knowledge Representation in a variety of AI systems.
- **Structure:**
  - Part I deals with general methods in Knowledge Representation and reasoning and covers such topics as classical logic in Knowledge Representation; satisfiability solvers; description logics; constraint programming; conceptual graphs; nonmonotonic reasoning; model-based problem solving; and Bayesian networks.
  - Part II focuses on classes of knowledge and specialized representations, with chapters on temporal representation and reasoning; spatial and physical reasoning; reasoning about knowledge and belief; temporal action logics; and nonmonotonic causal logic.
  - Part III discusses Knowledge Representation in applications such as question answering; the semantic web; automated planning; cognitive robotics; multi-agent systems; and knowledge engineering.
