### Machine Learning

> Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.

- **Readership:** _advanced undergraduates_
- This book focuses on **interpretable machine learning models** for tabular data (also called relational or structured data) and topics include computer vision and natural language processing tasks.
- Free E-Book: https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/

[**Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML)**](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1SM4M45ZAAR48&keywords=machine+learning+and+pattern+recognition&qid=1555256055&s=books&sprefix=machine+learning+and+p%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C601&sr=1-1), 2011, Christopher M. Bishop

- **Readership:** _advanced undergraduates_
- **Prerequisites:** _multivariate calculus, basic linear algebra_
- This is the first textbook on pattern recognition to present the Bayesian viewpoint. The book presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible. It uses graphical models to describe probability distributions when no other books apply graphical models to machine learning. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. , and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.

- **Readership:** _researchers_
- **Prerequisites:**: basic multivariate calculus, probability, linear algebra, MATLAB programming
- This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a **principled model-based approach**, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package―PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)―that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.

**Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (RLAI)**, Nov 5, 2017, Richard S. Sutton, Andrew G. Barto

- **Readership:** _advanced undergraduates_
- **Prerequisites:** _probability_
- This book provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives when interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In this book, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications.
- **Structure:**
  - Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes.
  - Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning.
  - Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.
