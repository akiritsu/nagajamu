### Downloadable software

* The knowledge gradient for independent, normal beliefs - This is the simplest case. [Click here for a spreadsheet implementation of the knowledge gradient for independent, normally distributed beliefs.](http://optimallearning.princeton.edu/software/KnowledgeGradient_IndependentNormal.xlsx)
* [The Optimal Learning Calculator](http://optimallearning.princeton.edu/software/OptimalLearningCalculator.zip) - A spreadsheet-based package that provides an introduction to learning and a variety of policies for learning. [For more information, click here](http://optimallearning.princeton.edu/#OL_calculator). We are developing an online tutorial, but at the moment you are on your own. Stay tuned. (Argh! Just learned that a change in the Java library means the code no longer runs on some machines due to a problem with how paths are handled - hope to have an update this summer).
