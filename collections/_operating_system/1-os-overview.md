[**Operating System Concepts**]

[**Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)**](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Three-Easy-Pieces/dp/198508659X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Operating+Systems%3A+Three+Easy+Pieces&qid=1555119804&s=gateway&sr=8-1)ï¼Œ v1.0, 2018, Remzi H. Arpaci, Andrea C. Arpaci

- The book is organized around three concepts fundamental to OS construction: **virtualization (of CPU and memory), concurrency (locks and condition variables), and persistence (disks, RAIDS, and file systems)**. The material, if combined with serious project work and homeworks, will lead students to a deeper understanding and appreciation of modern OSes.

- An **up-to-date** overview of operating systems presented by world-renowned computer scientist and author, Andrew Tanenbaum.
- **Structure:**
  - Part I covers processes, memory management, file systems, I/O systems, and deadlocks in single operating system environments.
  - Part II covers communication, synchronization process execution, and file systems in a distributed operating system environment.
  - Study cases including UNIX, Linux, Windows 8 and Android.

[**Operating Systems: Concurrent and Distributed Software Design**](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Jean-Bacon/dp/0321117891/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Operating+Systems%3A+Concurrent+and+Distributed+Software+Design&qid=1555120684&s=gateway&sr=8-1), 2003, Jean Bacon

- **Readership:** _advanced undergraduates and graduates, professionals_
- Underlying this book is the premise that distributed systems are now commonplace and a reader is more likely to be using one than a centralized time-sharing system. This modern approach therefore avoids the focus on centralized systems, instead placing the operating system within its context and providing an overview of system components and their relationships.
- **Structure:**
  - System Design, covering the basic operating system functions and describing the abstraction and implementation of a system as a community of (possibly distributed) concurrent processes. Distributed systems are introduced and a chapter on system security is included.
  - Concurrency Control in Main Memory, focusing on concurrency control in operating systems and application-level systems and exploring inter-process communication (IPC) in the context of (distributed) system design.
  - Transactions, demonstrating the general applicability of concurrent composite operations.
  - Case Studies, considering different systems in the light of the perspective developed in the book: Classical UNIX; Linux, Solaris and Contemporary Unix; Extensible Systems; Windows 2000; Web Programming; Middleware; and Transaction Processing Systems.The Java language has been used throughout to illustrate object-oriented concepts, concurrent algorithms and distributed programming and the book includes a chapter on system security. The case studies, covering a full suite of professional operating systems, enable the course to be taught as a blend of theory and practice, so that on completion of the course a student is able to adapt and build real operating systems that function within a distributed environment.
