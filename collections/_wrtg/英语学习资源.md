本文分三部分：1.英语学习方法；2.高中英语学习技巧；3.英语学习资源

## 一般英语学习方法

这一节的重点是去**学习“英语”这门语言本身**，全方位提高“听说读写”的能力，并不涉及应试技巧、得分能力。毕竟，扎实的基本功既是考高分的前提，又是成年以后工作、学习、科研的基石能力；过分强调应试技巧只能让自己的记忆被纷乱如麻、缺少规律的一条条“得分规则”被局限。

### 1. 进入英语语境，逃离母语依赖

如果能做到的话，尽量查“英英辞典”，而不是“英汉辞典”。


2. 拒绝脑内“中英翻译”

### 2.制作“cheatsheet”

Cheatsheet，也就是快速查询表，（不是作弊表哦）。

最常用的 Cheatsheet 就是不规则动词过去式、过去分词的表格。
