## Preliminaries

**Logic**
* Principles of reasoning.
* Havings a precisely defined syntax.
* Trade-off: gaining precision, sacrificing expressive power.

**Decision Problem**
* Given input as specified, asking "yes" or "no".

**Time Complexity**
* Concerns the *amount of time* it takes to answer a problem.
* *polynomial-time*: P.
* **Complexity Theory** classifies problems according to how difficult they are to solve.
