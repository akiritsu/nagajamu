[**Introduction to Expert Systems**](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Expert-Systems-Peter-Jackson/dp/0201876868/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Introduction+to+Expert+Systems&qid=1555042560&s=books&sr=1-1), 3rd Edition, Jackson P., Addison Wesley

- This third edition of Peter Jackson's best-selling book updates the **technological base of expert systems research** and embeds those developments in a wide variety of application areas. The earlier chapters have been refocused to take a more practical approach to the basic topics, while the later chapters introduce new topic areas such as case-based reasoning, connectionist systems and hybrid systems. Results in related areas, such as machine learning and reasoning with uncertainty, are also accorded a thorough treatment. The new edition contains many new examples and exercises, most of which are in CLIPS, a language that combines production rules with object-oriented programming. LISP, PROLOG and C++ are also featured where appropriate. Interesting problems are posed throughout, and are solved in exercises involving the analysis, design and implementation of CLIPS programs.

- The book examines the **principles of artificial intelligence and their application** to engineering and science, as well as **techniques for developing intelligent systems** to solve practical problems. Covering the full spectrum of intelligent systems techniques, it incorporates knowledge-based systems, computational intelligence, and their hybrids. New edition includes expanded and separated chapters on genetic algorithms and single-candidate optimization techniques, while the chapter on neural networks now covers spiking networks and a range of recurrent networks. The book also provides extended coverage of **fuzzy logic**, including type-2 and fuzzy control systems. Example programs using rules and uncertainty are presented in an industry-standard format, so that you can run them yourself.
