```elisp
;;; Chapter 4 SYNTAX & SEMANTICS

;; quote
;; Takes a single expression as its “argument” and simply returns it,special operator
(quote (+ 1 2))
;; Return: (+ 1 2)

;; (eq ARG0 ARG1)
;; Two objects are EQ if they’re identical. The object identity of numbers and characters depends on how those data types are implemented in a particular Lisp.

;; (eql ARG0 ARG1)
;; Behave like EQ except that it also is guaranteed to consider two objects of the same class representing the same numeric or character value to be equivalent.
(eql 1 1.0)
;; Return: NIL
(eql "c" "c")
;; Return: NIL

;; (equal ARG0 ARG1)
;; Loosens the discrimination of EQL to consider lists equivalent if they have the same structure and contents, recursively, according to EQUAL . EQUAL also considers strings equivalent if they contain the same characters.
(equal "c" "c")
;; Return: T

;; (equalp ARG0 ARG1)
;; Behave like EQUAL but ignore differences in case.
(equal "c" "C")
;; Return: t
```

#### NIL and T
NIL is the only object that’s both an atom and a list: in addition to falsehood, it’s also used to represent the empty list.The expressions nil, (), 'nil, and '() all evaluate to the same thing—the unquoted forms are evaluated as a reference to the constant variable whose value is the symbol NIL , but in the quoted forms the QUOTE special operator evaluates to the symbol directly.

The symbol T is the canonical true value and can be used when you need to return a non- NIL value and don’t have anything else handy.For the same reason as NIL, both t and 't will evaluate to the same thing: the symbol T .

```elisp
;;; Chapter 5 FUNCTIONS

;; (defun NAME ARGLIST &optional DOCSTRING DECL &rest BODY)

(defun hello-world (x) (format t "~a ,hello world!" x))
;; Return: HELLO-WORLD

;; (documentation X DOC-TYPE)
;; Get the documentation string of the object,function
(documentation 'foo 'function)
;; Return the DOCSTRING

;; return-from
;; Return from everywhere the specail operator is.

;; (funcall FUNCTION &REST ARGUMENTS)
;; Use when you know the number of arguments you’re going to pass to the function at the time you write the code. The first argument to FUNCALL is the function object to be invoked, and the rest of the arguments are passed onto that function,special operator.
(funcall 'list 1 2 3)
;; Return the result of FUNCTION,in the case above,(1 2 3)

;; (apply FUNCTION &rest ARGUMENTS)
;; (apply #'func func-args)==(func (first func-args) (second func-args) (third func-args) (fourth func-args........)),that is ,apply recieves a list as the lambda list of FUNCTION.
(apply #'list (list 1 2 3))
(apply #'append (list (list 1 2) (list 3)))
;; Return: (1 2 3)

;; (exp ARG0)
;; Return e^ARG0
(exp 1)
;; Return: 2.7182817

;; (lambda &WHOLE WHOLE-FORM LAMBDALIST &BODY BODY) [2 times]
(lambda (x) (* x 2))
;; Return: #<FUNCTION :LAMBDA (X) (* X 2)>
```


#### Mixing Different Parameter Types

(required-parameters optional-parameters rest-parameters keyword-parameters)

Only keyword-parameters isn't positional.

If both &rest and &key appear in a parameter list, then both things happen—all the remaining values, which include the keywords themselves, are gathered into a list that’s bound to the &rest parameter, and the appropriate values are also bound to the &key parameters. So, given this function:

```elisp
(defun foo (&rest rest &key a b c) (list rest a b c))
```

\> (foo :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)

((:A 1 :B 2 :C 3) 1 2 3)

#### Default Parameter Value

```elisp
;; With no parameters,assign width and height with 1; with one paramters,assign height with width presented.In other words,make squares...
(defun rectangle-area (&optional (width 1) (height width)))
```

#### ARG and ARG-SUPPLIED-P
ARG-SUPPLIED-P is designed to know whether the value of an optional argument was supplied by the caller or is the default value.By convention, these variables are usually named the same as the actual parameter with a “-supplied-p” on the end. For example:

```elisp
(defun foo (a b &optional (c 3 c-supplied-p))
  (list a b c c-supplied-p))
```

\> (foo 1 2)

(1 2 NIL)

\> (foo 1 2 3)

(1 2 3 T)

#### Anonymous Functions - LAMBDA Expression

1.Anonymous functions can be useful when you need to pass a function as an argument to another function and the function you need to pass is simple enough to express inline.

2.The other important use of LAMBDA expressions is in making closures, functions that capture part of the environment where they’re created.

#### Binding Forms

The scope of function parameters and LET variables—the area of the program where the variable name can be used to refer to the variable’s binding—is delimited by the form that introduces the variable. This form—the function definition or the LET —is called the binding form.

#### Differences of DEFVAR and DEFPARAMETER

In short, DEFVAR can use to define unbinded variables and bind a value to an unbinded variables.DEFPARAMETER always bind a variable (binded or unbinded) with a value.

The difference between the two forms is that DEFPARAMETER always assigns the initial value to the named variable while DEFVAR does so only if the variable is undefined. A DEFVAR form can also be used with no initial value to define a global variable without giving it a value. Such a variable is said to be unbound.

Practically speaking, you should use DEFVAR to define variables that will contain data you’d want to keep even if you made a change to the source code that uses the variable. For instance, suppose the two variables defined previously are part of an application for control- ling a widget factory. It’s appropriate to define the *count* variable with DEFVAR because the number of widgets made so far isn’t invalidated just because you make some changes to the widget-making code.

#### Some boring tests

#### Define WHEN and UNLESS

```elisp
(defmacro when (condition &rest body)
`(if ,condition (progn ,@body)))

(defmacro unless (condition &rest body)
`(if (not ,condition) (progn ,@body)))
```

#### Short-circuit in AND & OR

Macro AND & OR evaluate only as many of their subforms—in left-to-right order—as necessary to determine the overall truth value. Thus, AND stops and returns NIL as soon as one of its subforms evaluates to NIL . If all the subforms evaluate to non- NIL , it returns the value of the last subform. OR , on the other hand, stops as soon as one of its subforms evaluates to non- NIL and returns the resulting value. If none of the subforms evaluate to true, OR returns NIL .

#### DO always use OLD values to build NEW values!

At each step of the iteration the step forms for all the variables are evaluated before assigning any of the values to the variables. This means you can refer to any of the other loop variables in the step forms. 6 That is, in a loop like this:

```elisp
(do ((n 0 (1+ n)
  (cur 0 next)
  (next 1 (+ cur next)))
  ((= 10 n) cur))
```

the step forms (1+ n), next, and (+ cur next) are all evaluated using the OLD values of n, cur, and next.

;; Return: ONCE-ONLY

;; (gensym &OPTIONAL (THING G))
;; Returns a unique symbol each time it’s called. This is a symbol that has never been read by the Lisp reader and never will be because it isn’t interned in any package, function.

;; Return: #:G721, perhaps...

  `(LET ((,#:G730 ,QUOTE) (,#:G731 ,A))
     ,(LET ((QUOTE #:G730) (A #:G731))
           'B)))
T
```

#### Macro Expansion Time & Runtime

The key to understanding macros is to be quite clear about the distinction between the code that generates code (macros) and the code that eventually makes up the program (everything else). When you write macros, you’re writing programs that will be used by the compiler to generate the code that will then be compiled. Only after all the macros have been fully expandedand the resulting code compiled can the program actually be run. The time when macros run is called macro expansion time; this is distinct from runtime, when regular code, including the code generated by macros, runs.

#### General Steps to Writing Macros

1. Write a sample call to the macro and the code it should expand into, or vice versa.
2. Write code that generates the handwritten expansion from the arguments in the
sample call.
3. Make sure the macro abstraction doesn’t “leak.”

#### , and ,@

```elisp
CL-USER> `(list 1 2 3 ,(list 1 2 3))
(LIST 1 2 3 (1 2 3))
CL-USER> `(list 1 2 3 ,@(list 1 2 3))
(LIST 1 2 3 1 2 3)
```

#### Leaks and Rules preventing Leaks

LEAKS:

1. Multiple evaluate for a form (value) which should be execute only 1 time (identical one).
2. Disruption to sequence of evaluate the formal parameter.
3. A binding may cause conflicts to value name.

RULES:

1. Unless there’s a particular reason to do otherwise, include any subforms in the expansion in positions that will be evaluated in the same order as the subforms appear in the macro call.
2. Unless there’s a particular reason to do otherwise, make sure subforms are evaluated only once by creating a variable in the expansion to hold the value of evaluating the argument form and then using that variable anywhere else the value is needed in the expansion.
3. Use GENSYM at macro expansion time to create variable names used in the expansion.

1.The functions < , > , <= , and >= order rationals and floating-point numbers (in other words, the real numbers.) Like = and /= , these functions can be called with more than two arguments, in which case each argument is compared to the argument to its right.

2.Like = , CHAR= can take any number of arguments and returns true only if they’re all the same character.

3.The string comparators can compare only two strings. That’s because they also take keyword arguments that allow you to restrict the comparison to a substring of either or both strings. The arguments—:start1, :end1, :start2, and :end2—specify the starting (inclusive) and ending (exclusive) indices of substrings in the first and second string arguments.

```elisp
(string= "foobarbaz" "quuxbarfoo" :start1 3 :end1 6 :start2 4 :end2 7)
;; Return: T

(string/= "lisp" "lissome")
;; Return: 3, the index.

(string< "lisp" "lisper")
;; Return: 4, the index.
```



#### Something about Numbers

Binary number: #B or #b

Octal number: #O or #o

Hexadecimal: #X or #x

Others base: #nR and n is the base from 2 to 36. (0-Z)

The digits in a floating-point number are always treated as base 10 digits—the #B, #X, #O, and #R syntaxes work only with rationals.

Complex numbers: #c(real-part imaginary-part)

#### REM and MOD

Two related functions are MOD and REM , which return the modulus and remainder of a truncating division on real numbers. These two functions are related to the FLOOR and TRUNCATE functions as follows:

(+ (* (floor(/ x y)) y) (mod x y)) ≡ x

(+ (* (truncate (/ x y)) y) (rem x y)) ≡ x

Thus, for positive quotients they’re equivalent, but for negative quotients they produce different results.

#### 1+, 1-, INCF and DECF

1+ and 1- are just functions that return a new value, but INCF and DECF modify a place.

If the predicate is always satisfied, it returns true. SOME returns the first non- NIL value returned by the predicate or returns false if the predicate is never satisfied.

```

### COMPLEMENT & :test-not

Another parameter, :test-not parameter, specifies a two-argument predicate to be used like a :test argument except with the boolean result logically reversed. This parameter is deprecated, however, in preference for using the COMPLEMENT function. COMPLEMENT takes a function argument and returns a function that takes the same number of arguments as the original and returns the logical complement of the original function. Thus, you can, and should, write this:

(count x sequence :test (complement #'some-test))

rather than the following:

(count x sequence :test-not #'some-test)

### COPY-SEQ & REVERSE

Neither function copies the elements themselves—only the returned sequence is a new object.

#### Useful Forms of Recycling Functions.

1.PUSH & NREVERSE
The most common recycling idiom is to build up a list to be returned from a function by “consing” onto the front of a list, usually by PUSH ing elements onto a list stored in a local variable and then returning the result of NREVERSE ing it.

This is an efficient way to build a list because each PUSH has to create only one cons cell and modify a local variable and the NREVERSE just has to zip down the list reassigning the CDR s. Because the list is created entirely within the function, there’s no danger any code outside the function has a reference to any of its cons cells. Here’s a function that uses this idiom to build a list of the first n numbers, starting at zero:

```elisp
(defun upto (max)
  (let ((result nil))
    (dotimes (i max)
      (push i result))
    (nreverse result)))

(upto 10)
;; Return: (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
```

2.SETF & DELETE
The next most common recycling idiom 9 is to immediately reassign the value returned by the recycling function back to the place containing the potentially recycled value.


```elisp
(setf foo (delete nil foo))
```

Sets the value of foo to its old value except with all the NIL s removed. However, even this idiom must be used with some care—if foo shares structure with lists referenced elsewhere, using DELETE instead of REMOVE can destroy the structure of those other lists.

#### Use WITH-OPEN-FILE !
You’ll probably use WITH-OPEN-FILE for 90–99 percent of the file I/O you do—the only time you need to use raw OPEN and CLOSE calls is if you need to open a file in a function and keep the stream around after the function returns. In that case, you must take care to eventually close the stream yourself, or you’ll leak file descriptors and may eventually end up unable to open any more files.

#### Other Kinds of I/O
In addition to file streams, Common Lisp supports other kinds of streams, which can also be used with the various reading, writing, and printing I/O functions. For instance, you can read data from, or write data to, a string using STRING-STREAM s, which you can create with the functions MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM and MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM .

MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM takes a string and optional start and end indices to bound the area of the string from which data should be read and returns a character stream that you can pass to any of the character-based input functions such as READ-CHAR , READ-LINE , or READ . For example, if you have a string containing a floating-point literal in Common Lisp’s syntax, you can convert it to a float like this:
```elisp
(let ((s (make-string-input-stream "1.23")))
  (unwind-protect (read s)
    (close s)))
```

Similarly, MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM creates a stream you can use with FORMAT ,
PRINT , WRITE-CHAR , WRITE-LINE , and so on. It takes no arguments. Whatever you write, a
string output stream will be accumulated into a string that can then be obtained with the function
GET-OUTPUT-STREAM-STRING . Each time you call GET-OUTPUT-STREAM-STRING , the stream’s
internal string is cleared so you can reuse an existing string output stream.

However, you’ll rarely use these functions directly, because the macros
WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING and WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING provide a more convenient
interface. WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING is similar to WITH-OPEN-FILE —it creates a string input
stream from a given string and then executes the forms in its body with the stream bound to the
variable you provide. For instance, instead of the LET form with the explicit UNWIND-PROTECT ,
you’d probably write this:
```elisp
(with-input-from-string (s "1.23")
(read s))
```
The WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING macro is similar: it binds a newly created string output
stream to a variable you name and then executes its body. After all the body forms have been
executed, WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING returns the value that would be returned by
GET-OUTPUT-STREAM-STRING .
```elisp
CL-USER> (with-output-to-string (out)
(format out "hello, world ")
(format out "~s" (list 1 2 3)))
"hello, world (1 2 3)"
```
The other kinds of streams defined in the language standard provide various kinds of
stream “plumbing,” allowing you to plug together streams in almost any configuration. A
BROADCAST-STREAM is an output stream that sends any data written to it to a set of output
streams provided as arguments to its constructor function, MAKE-BROADCAST-STREAM . 14
Conversely, a CONCATENATED-STREAM is an input stream that takes its input from a set of input
streams, moving from stream to stream as it hits the end of each stream.
CONCATENATED-STREAM s are constructed with the function MAKE-CONCATENATED-STREAM ,
which takes any number of input streams as arguments.

Two kinds of bidirectional streams that can plug together streams in a couple ways are
TWO-WAY-STREAM and ECHO-STREAM . Their constructor functions, MAKE-TWO-WAY-STREAM and
MAKE-ECHO-STREAM , both take two arguments, an input stream and an output stream, and
return a stream of the appropriate type, which you can use with both input and output functions.

In a TWO-WAY-STREAM every read you perform will return data read from the underlying
input stream, and every write will send data to the underlying output stream. An ECHO-STREAM
works essentially the same way except that all the data read from the underlying input stream
is also echoed to the output stream. Thus, the output stream of an ECHO-STREAM stream will
contain a transcript of both sides of the conversation.

Using these five kinds of streams, you can build almost any topology of stream plumbing
you want.

Finally, although the Common Lisp standard doesn’t say anything about networking APIs,
most implementations support socket programming and typically implement sockets as
another kind of stream, so you can use all the regular I/O functions with them.

Now you’re ready to move on to building a library that smoothes over some of the differences
between how the basic pathname functions behave in different Common Lisp implementations.

#### Print Objects

Printing of all objects is implemented in terms of a generic function PRINT-OBJECT. To make implementing such methods easier, Common Lisp provides the macro PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT. The main reason to use PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT is that it takes care of signaling the appropriate error if someone tries to print your object readably, such as with the ~S FORMAT directive.

### CASE CCASE ECASE

*case*

case keyform {normal-clause}* [otherwise-clause]

If no normal-clause matches, and there is an otherwise-clause, then that otherwise-clause automatically matches; the forms in that clause are evaluated as an implicit progn, and the values it returns are returned as the value of the case.

If there is no otherwise-clause, case returns nil.

*ccase*
ccase keyplace {normal-clause}*

If no normal-clause matches, a correctable error of type type-error is signaled. The offending datum is the test-key and the expected type is type equivalent to (member key1 key2 ...). The store-value restart can be used to correct the error.

If the store-value restart is invoked, its argument becomes the new test-key, and is stored in keyplace as if by (setf keyplace test-key). Then ccase starts over, considering each clause anew.

The subforms of keyplace might be evaluated again if none of the cases holds.

*ecase*

ecase keyform {normal-clause}*

If no normal-clause matches, a non-correctable error of type type-error is signaled. The offending datum is the test-key and the expected type is type equivalent to (member key1 key2 ...).

Note that in contrast with ccase, the caller of ecase may rely on the fact that ecase does not return if a normal-clause does not match.

```elisp
(defun test-case (x)
   (case x
     ((i uno) 1)
     ((ii dos) 2)
     ((iii tres) 3)
     ((iv cuatro) 4)))
