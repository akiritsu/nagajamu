本文分三部分：1.英语学习方法；2.高中英语学习技巧；3.英语学习资源

## 一般的英语学习方法

这一节的重点是去**学习“英语”这门语言本身**，全方位提高“听说读写”的能力，并不涉及应试技巧、得分能力。毕竟，扎实的基本功既是考高分的前提，又是成年以后工作、学习、科研的基石能力；过分强调应试技巧只能让自己的记忆被纷乱如麻、缺少规律的一条条“得分规则”被局限。

### 1. 进入英语语境，逃离母语依赖，拒绝脑内“中英翻译”

之前很多人都错误地传播了一个观点，即人类最佳学习语言的时间是 6 岁以前。如果 6 岁之前不接触英语，后边就很难学好了。这个观点犯了极大的错误。之所以会产生这个“现象”，其原因有二：
  - 其一是，当一个人**熟练掌握自己的母语之后，便会在不知不觉间完全依赖了母语交流的方式（所谓“路径依赖”）**，一直生活在自己的“舒适区”，把英语当成刻板无聊的一条条知识去学（孤立的知识）。而英语是交流使用的语言，不是知识，和母语功能相同（相互联系、紧密交织的交流工具）。一个事实是，国外很多 Youtuber 都可以在 6 个月内流利说一门新语言，并在 Youtube 上分享心得。而他们显然并非什么天才——而是**使用了正确的学习方法，去除了母语依赖**。
  - 其二是，根据语言学的观点，**“语言就是思维本身”**。这个理论可能对于中学生来说稍难理解，不过我们可能听说过**东西方思维差异很大，用中国思维去理解英语，一定学不好英语**——这就是东西方思维差异的一个体现。语言学对此的解释是，**语言不同导致思维不同**（而不是相反，思维不同导致语言不同）。

所以，解决这两个问题的必胜法诀就是——**逃离母语依赖**。


如果能做到的话，尽量查“英英辞典”，而不是“英汉辞典”。


1. 拒绝脑内“中英翻译”

2. 在生活中积累词汇量

## Appendix. 一些背单词的方法：



## 高中英语学习技巧

### 1.单词的记忆

记忆单词时，重复性地背“fool——傻瓜——”、“fool——傻瓜——”、“fool——傻瓜——”……不能说收效甚微吧，也能说是毫无作用了。除了记忆效率很差以外，还有


### 1.注重多义词

重点关注常见“多种含义的常见词”，有必要的话，将其所有含义总结下来，并附例句。

如 book 一词，其常见含义是 n.书籍、本子。在高中英语中，还需要记忆另外一个含义，v.预定、预约。

### 2.制作“cheatsheet”

Cheatsheet，也就是快速查询表，（不是作弊表哦）。

最常用的 Cheatsheet 就是不规则动词过去式、过去分词的表格。
