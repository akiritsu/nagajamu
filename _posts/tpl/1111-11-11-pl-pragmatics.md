[**Programming Language Pragmatics (PLP)**](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Pragmatics-Michael-Scott/dp/0124104096/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Programming+Language+Pragmatics&qid=1555157026&s=books&sr=1-1), 4th Edition, 2015, Michael L. Scott

- Programming Language Pragmatics, Fourth Edition, is the most comprehensive programming language textbook available today. It is distinguished and acclaimed for its integrated treatment of **language design and implementation**, with an emphasis on the fundamental tradeoffs that continue to drive software development.
- The book provides readers with a solid foundation in the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the full range of programming languages, from traditional languages like C to the latest in functional, scripting, and object-oriented programming. This fourth edition has been heavily revised throughout, with expanded coverage of type systems and functional programming, a unified treatment of polymorphism, highlights of the newest language standards, and examples featuring the ARM and x86 64-bit architectures.

[**Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming (CTMCP)**](https://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Programming/dp/0262220695/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Concepts%2C+Techniques+and+Models+of+Computer+Programming&qid=1555157112&s=books&sr=1-1), 1st Edition, 2004, Peter Van Roy, Seif Haridi

- This book discusses the science and the technology of programming as a unified discipline that shows the **deep relationships between programming paradigms**. The book focuses on techniques of lasting value and explains them precisely in terms of a simple abstract machine. The book presents all major programming paradigms in a uniform framework that shows their deep relationships and how and where to use them together. After an introduction to programming concepts, the book presents both well-known and lesser-known computation models ("programming paradigms"). Each model has its own set of techniques and each is included on the basis of its usefulness in practice. The general models include declarative programming, declarative concurrency, message-passing concurrency, explicit state, object-oriented programming, shared-state concurrency, and relational programming. Specialized models include graphical user interface programming, distributed programming, and constraint programming. Each model is based on its kernel languageâ€•a simple core language that consists of a small number of programmer-significant elements. The kernel languages are introduced progressively, adding concepts one by one, thus showing the deep relationships between different models. The kernel languages are defined precisely in terms of a simple abstract machine. Because a wide variety of languages and programming paradigms can be modeled by a small set of closely related kernel languages, this approach allows programmer and student to grasp the underlying unity of programming. The book has many program fragments and exercises, all of which can be run on the Mozart Programming System, an Open Source software package that features an interactive incremental development environment.


[**Types and Programming Languages (TAPL)**](https://www.amazon.com/Types-Programming-Languages-MIT-Press/dp/0262162091/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Types+and+Programming+Languages&qid=1555161965&s=books&sr=1-1), 2002, Benjamin C. Pierce

- **Readership:** _freshmen to types, advanced undergraduates and graduates, professionals_
- This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to **type systems** in computer science and to the **basic theory of programming languages**. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material.
- **Topics:** untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, type operators
